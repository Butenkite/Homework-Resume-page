          <p>
            I've always been interested in computers as I've always been
            surronded by it at home. I was 9 when I had built my first computer
            on my own, and shortly after had been writing LUA scripts, videogame
            mods, and digging around the source of websites. Its what I do and
            what I am interested in, so
            <a href="#">Click Here</a> get to know me better and get a glimpse
            into my personal and academic journey!

            development and collaborative projects highlighting the creative and
            technical skills I've honed through various challenges and

            daily.
